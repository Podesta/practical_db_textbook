    *In God we trust, all others bring data.*

    -- attributed to W. Edwards Deming

This chapter mostly aims to get you thinking about what it is we are studying when we study databases.

What is data? What is a database?

What is data?  A dictionary may tell you that *data* is the plural of *datum*, and that a datum is a piece of information or a fact.  Okay, so data is pieces of information.  Living in the "information age", we hear a lot about the importance of data.  Companies like Google and Facebook collect lots and lots of data.  Data must be very useful!  

Here are some data:

- The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is :math:`\pi`
- Elephants are classified as belonging to the taxonomic order Proboscidea
- The population of planet earth in 2018 was approximately 7.6 billion
- My given name is "Christopher"

Are these useful?  Why or why not?
